# MOVED

If you want to run spidermonkey on your iOS/Android device, you should check [my fork](https://github.com/funkaster/mozilla-central) of the [official mozilla-central](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central) project.

# PREBUILT

You can download a [prebuilt version](https://github.com/funkaster/mozilla-central/downloads) if you want. The library is a fat version (armv7, armv7s and i386).
